							<h1>Hi there! My name is Miriam. Welcome to my personal homepage.</h1>

							<!-- Text -->
								<section>
									<p>I am an economics and computer science student, living in Munich and Liverpool. I am interested in topics that combine economics, computer science, and statistics.</p>

								<h3>About Me</h3>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="" /></span>I hold a Bachelor of Science in Economics from the University of Munich (LMU Munich). After attending compulsory modules in statistics and econometrics, I specialised in applied econometrics.
									I am also aiming for a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the LMU Munich, which I expect to obtain in summer 2020.
									In the academic year 2018/2019 I studied at the University of Liverpool on a scholarship as a visiting student.
							    There I attended advanced bachelor and master courses on Algorithmic Game Theory &amp Mechanism Design, Optimisation, Data Mining, and Neural Networks.
								  This spring, I will be writing my bachelor's thesis on stackelberg routing in routing games and &epsilon;-approximate equilibria.</p>
								<p>Outside uni campus, you'll probably see me hanging out in cafes with my friends, following current affairs, or riding my bicycle.

							<h6 id="modules">Additional modules information</h6>
							<p>Comparing modules from different universities with each other with regard to their equivalence can be quite the hussle.

						<blockquote>A physicist, a chemist and an economist are stranded on an island, with nothing to eat. A can of soup washes ashore. The physicist says, “Let's smash the can open with a rock.” The chemist says, “Let’s build a fire and heat the can first.” The economist says, “Let's assume that we have a can-opener...” </blockquote>
