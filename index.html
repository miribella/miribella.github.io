							<h1>Hi there! My name is Miriam. Welcome to my personal homepage.</h1>

								<section>
									<p>I am an economics and computer science student, with interests from microeconomics to computational complexity.
										I'm mainly interested in Game Theory and Mechanism Design, Data Science, and Optimisation, but I can get excited about everything that takes interdisciplinary approaches to economics, computer sciences, and statistics.
										I am currently obtaining a M.Sc. in Operations Research with Data Science.</p>

								<h6>About Me</h6>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="" /></span>I hold a Bachelor of Science in Economics and a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, both from the University of Munich (LMU Munich).
									After attending compulsory modules in statistics and econometrics, I specialised in game theory and applied econometrics.
									I wrote my bachelor thesis on comparing the complexity of strategies by counting the number of states needed to model the strategies as finite automata.
									For my studies in Computer Science, I studied at the University of Liverpool on a scholarship as a visiting student 2018/2019.
							    There I attended advanced bachelor and master courses on Algorithmic Game Theory &amp Mechanism Design, Optimisation, Data Mining, and Neural Networks.
									My bachelor thesis, Stackelberg routing with fairness considerations, dealt with a new type of Stackelberg routing in which the Stackelberg leader is restricted in
									the factor she is allowed to put controlled players worse off than selfish players. I investigated how this effects the Price of Anarchy and tried to come up with fair Stackelberg strategies.</p>
									
								<p>You can download my CV and my Bachelor's thesis on Stackelberg routing with fairness considerations below.</p>

							<p>Comparing modules from different universities with each other with regard to their equivalence can be quite the hussle.
								In order to simplify these troubles a little, the following is a list of courses that have given me particularly relevant  knowledge and skills for my further studies, as well as an outline of their respective content.</p>

						<blockquote>A physicist, a chemist and an economist are stranded on an island, with nothing to eat. A can of soup washes ashore. The physicist says, “Let's smash the can open with a rock.” The chemist says, “Let’s build a fire and heat the can first.” The economist says, “Let's assume that we have a can-opener...” </blockquote>

						<blockquote>A mathematician, an engineer, and a computer scientist are riding in a car, enjoying the countryside, when suddenly the engine stops working. The mathematician says, "We came past a gas station a few minutes ago. Someone should go back and ask for help." The engineer says, "I should have a look at the engine. Perhaps, I can fix it." The computer scientist says: "Why don't we just open the doors, slam them shut, and see if everything works again?"</blockquote>

						<blockquote>A computer scientist, an economist, and a statistician go hunting. They spot a deer, and take aim. The economist shoots first and misses 10 meters to the right. The computer scientist shoots next and misses 10 meters to the left. The statistician then throws down their gun and proclaims, “we got it!”</blockquote>
