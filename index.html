							<h1>Hi there! My name is Miriam. Welcome to my personal homepage.</h1>

								<section>
									<p>I am an economics and computer science student, living in Munich and Liverpool.
										I'm mainly interested in Game Theory and Mechanism Design, Data Science, and Optimisation, but I can get excited about everything that takes interdisciplinary approaches to economics, computer sciences, and statistics.
										In order to combine my passions, I would like to deepen my knowledge in the field of Operations Research in my further studies.</p>

								<h6>About Me</h6>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="" /></span>I hold a Bachelor of Science in Economics from the University of Munich (LMU Munich).
									After attending compulsory modules in statistics and econometrics, I specialised in game theory and applied econometrics.
									I wrote my bachelor thesis on comparing the complexity of strategies by counting the number of states needed to model the strategies as finite automata.
									I am also aiming for a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the LMU Munich, which I expect to obtain in summer 2020.
									In the academic year 2018/2019 I studied at the University of Liverpool on a scholarship as a visiting student.
							    There I attended advanced bachelor and master courses on Algorithmic Game Theory &amp Mechanism Design, Optimisation, Data Mining, and Neural Networks.
								  This spring, I will be writing my bachelor's thesis on stackelberg routing in routing games and &epsilon;-approximate Nash equilibria.</p>
								<p>Off campus, you'll probably see me hanging out in cafes with my friends, following current affairs, or riding my bicycle.

							<h6 id="modules">Additional modules information</h6>
							<p>Comparing modules from different universities with each other with regard to their equivalence can be quite the hussle.

						<blockquote>A physicist, a chemist and an economist are stranded on an island, with nothing to eat. A can of soup washes ashore. The physicist says, “Let's smash the can open with a rock.” The chemist says, “Let’s build a fire and heat the can first.” The economist says, “Let's assume that we have a can-opener...” </blockquote>

						<blockquote>A mathematician, an engineer, and a computer scientist are riding in a car, enjoying the countryside, when suddenly the engine stops working. The mathematician says, "We came past a gas station a few minutes ago. Someone should go back and ask for help." The engineer says, "I should have a look at the engine. Perhaps, I can fix it." The computer scientist says: "Why don't we just open the doors, slam them shut, and see if everything works again?"</blockquote>

						<blockquote>A computer scientist, an economist, and a statistician go hunting. They spot a deer, and take aim. The economist shoots first and misses 10 meters to the right. The computer scientist shoots next and misses 10 meters to the left. The statistician then throws down their gun and proclaims, “we got it!”</blockquote>
